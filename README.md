# tech-talks

A collection of tech talks and presentations

If you have contributions you would like to make, I encourage you to make a PR.

If you spot any issues or want to ask questions, feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/nchlswhttkr/tech-talks/issues/new).

The slides for these talks are generated using [Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/), I store copies of each finished talk in markdown files (`presentation.md`), as well as `.png` images of each slide. To run with speaker notes, please use Deckset.

Code used in talks is usually hosted on a separate repo or gist, and linked using submodules.

### [Git and Open Source](./git)

[![The logos of Git, GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket](./git/git-and-open-source.png)](./git)

Presented as part of a series of tech talks with [WIRED Monash](https://wired.org.au).

> The first step for any good developer is setting up source control for the code they write. We'll be covering the basics of Git (a version control system designed for versioning code), some of the available service providers, and how you can use this to build a foundation for good coding habits.

Hacktoberfest 2019 at Monash University, a workshop in parternship between [MonSec](https://monsec.io) and [WIRED](https://wired.org.au).

> Come along for free food and an opportunity to earn a free shirt as well!

> What is Hacktoberfest?

> Hacktoberfest is a month-long event taking place in October each year. Focused on the world of open source development, participants can earn a free shirt just by making OSS contributions!

> Earn a free shirt? What’s the catch?

> If you make 4 pull requests to public repositories on GitHub in October, you will qualify for a shirt! Shipping is handled by event sponsors Digital Ocean and DEV, so you just need to focus on making 4 quality contributions to open source repositories.

> What does this have to do with MonSec?

> We’ll be looking at how vulnerabilities/insecurities are reported and resolved in the real world, and how it ties in with open source development!

> We’re running this event so that everyone can learn how they can contribute to the open source movement. We’ll have a simple demonstration that you can follow along with, and people on hand to answer your questions and help you if needed.

# tech-talks

A collection of tech talks and presentations

If you have contributions you would like to make, I encourage you to make a PR.

If you spot any issues or want to ask questions, feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/nchlswhttkr/tech-talks/issues/new).

The slides for these talks are generated using [Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/), I store copies of each finished talk in markdown files (`presentation.md`), as well as `.png` images of each slide. To run with speaker notes, please use Deckset.

Code used in talks is usually hosted on a separate repo or gist, and linked using submodules.
